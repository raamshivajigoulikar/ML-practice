Part 1. Machine Learning:
In the zip file you have 4 files:
- tabla_fondos: Detail of 29,800 funds (name, category, profitability, volatility and
minimum contribution of each fund).
- perfiles_inversores: Detail of the risk profile of 89,900 customers.
- asignacion_fondos: Detail of the funds allocated to the 79,900 first clients. The
10,000 last you do not have them.
- asignacion_dinero: Detail of the money allocated to each fund in the first 79,900
customers. The last 10,000 do not have them.

It is requested, with accuracy > 80%
- What funds have we recommended to the last 10,000 clients?
- What amount have we allocated to each fund?
- The Python code of the solution and a small report of what has be done.
- ETL and XGboost preferred.

Part 2: Deep learning.
In the Machine Learning test we start from tagged data (the funds allocated to each
profile). Suppose now that this allocation is not optimal.
Develop a Deep Learning model that allocates the funds to the different profiles.
You can use the network you estimate to develop the model.
The objective will be to maximize the profitability of each client, according to their risk profile.

It is requested.
- What funds have we recommended to all clients?
- What amount have we allocated to each client?
- The Python code of the solution and a small report of what has be done.
