#This is for practice session on the learning activity on Kaggle.com site for Melbourne House price prediction using Python.
1. Get the data from Kaggle.com site by searching Housing Price prediction in the datasets search option and get the Melbourne Housing price 
price datasets. The zip file will have two csv files one with name ending as FULL and other with LESS.
Unzip and store the datasets in your PC.
2. Read the csv file with FULL data with pandas dataframe and do the cleanup by removing not NA values by using notna function for pandas.
3. Define the predictor variables.
4. Create a list of values which need to be predicted that is stored in y.
5. Create a list of predictors values into a dataframe and name it as x.
Difference between Underfitting and Overfitting.
  In underfitting the model will not be able to capture all the patterns and behvaiours of the Training data whereas in Overfitting the model 
  captures all the data in Training data and will be able to match almost exactly the training data so it may fail with any new data.
